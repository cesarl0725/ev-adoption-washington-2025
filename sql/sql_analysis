Question 1: “What are the top 10 counties with the most electric cars?”
Analysis Query 1
- Purpose: To solve the first analysis question, "What are the top 10 counties with the most electric cars?". This is done by counting the
distinct rows of the table through the count() and grouping them by the county. Allowing us to discover the distribution of
electric vehicles by county.

- Code detail/insight: During the first version of this query, I made a vital mistake, as I did not use distinct within count()
making my result inaccurate, as Vin instances sometimes repeat. Thankfully, I caught on and fixed the error.

Question 2: "What are the top 5 most popular car brands within the top 10 counties?"
Analysis Query 2
- Purpose: To see the number of EVs owned for each brand in each county to identify the 5 most popular
brands in each county during the visualization process.

- Code detail/insight during the production of this query, I had trouble deciding how to structure the COUNT() function.
After thinking over it, I decided to go with COUNT(DISTINCT vin) as this allows me to get only the unique vehicles in each
county.
