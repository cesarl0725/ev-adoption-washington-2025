/*
Query 1
- Purpose: The purpose of this query is to streamline the clean_alternative_fuel_vehicle_(cafv)_eligibility column.
This allows the audience to be able to clearly understand what they are seeing when interacting with 
visuals related to this column.

- Code detail: To make sure I accounted for all the posibilities in my case statement I included ELSE 'DOUBLE CHECK' so in the 
case that I missed a posibility I would be able to tell immediately and fix my mistake.
